# Predicting-Mortality-in-Sepsis-Associated-Acute-Respiratory-Distress-Syndrome-ARDS-
Built and validated a machine learning model to predict mortality in Sepsis-Associated ARDS using the MIMIC-III database. Logistic Regression achieved the highest AUC (0.75), while Naive Bayes maximized recall, crucial for identifying critical cases. The project highlights the importance of predictive analytics in improving clinical outcomes.
