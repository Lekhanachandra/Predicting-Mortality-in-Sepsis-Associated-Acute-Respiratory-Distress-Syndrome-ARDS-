# Sepsis-Associated ARDS Mortality Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict mortality in patients with sepsis-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) using the MIMIC-III clinical database. We engineered clinical and lab features (e.g., lactate, bilirubin, SOFA scores) and evaluated seven ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.
Logistic Regression offered the best balance (AUC: 0.75), while Naive Bayes delivered the highest recall (0.89), which is critical in clinical settings to avoid missed diagnoses. This work demonstrates the potential of ML in early risk assessment and ICU resource planning.
